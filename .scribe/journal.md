# Scribe's Journal - Knowledge Gaps & Ambiguities

## Initial Analysis
- **Structure**: Two main directories `base-hardhat` (Game Logic) and `ron-base` (Bridge/Deposit?).
- **Documentation**: Minimal. `ron-base` has some deployment docs. `base-hardhat` is undocumented.

## Ambiguities
- [ ] Need to confirm the relationship between `ron-base` and `base-hardhat`. Are they deployed together? Or separate systems?
- [ ] `NativeTokenDepositor` purpose needs clarification.
- [ ] Complexity of `base-hardhat` contracts needs to be mapped.
